# Freespeech

A free program designed to help the non-verbal.

## Why Was This Created?

Freespeech was created in response to the few programs out there for non-verbal people that all cost upwards of $200 to $300. As a sibling of a non-verbal sister, I understand that these heavy costs can be big investments for families, especially ones that are not in the financial position to spend that kind of money. I hope Freespeech can get to the point where it can be a viable alternative to the other expensive apps out there. My goal is to help people communicate without a hefty cost.

Many people requested to donate to the project. I'd first recommend you donate to the [Make A Wish](https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=donate_now&chid=100-000) charity as they gave my Sister, Della, a wish. If you feel inclined to donate to me and the development of this project, feel free to support me on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/merkie). I am trying to buy myself a new computer as I am currently developing off my parent's laptop. Any money left over after expenses will go to Make A Wish.
